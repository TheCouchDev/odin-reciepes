        Ah yes, lasagna's cousin... or well not really but this is a much
        easier, arguably cheesier, casserole style pasta dish that is full of
        well... lots of cheese, rich meaty tomato sauce, and of course ziti
        pasta. But we are taking it several steps further to take it far beyond
        what it normally is.

    <h4><u>INSTRUCTIONS:</u></h4>
    <div class="section">
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 and spray a 9x13.</li>
        <li>
          In a 5 quart dutch oven, add vegetable oil to coat the bottom and heat
          over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in the meat and sear for 2-3 minutes. Flip and sear on the other
          side until browned. Mash the meat using a potato masher.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the meat cook over medium-high heat until the fat renders out and
          the meat is a bit crispy. Remove from the pot and place to the side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add olive oil to the pot and add in the diced sweet onion. Season with
          salt and saute for 3 minutes. Add in finely chopped garlic and saute
          for 20 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the meat back to the pot and mix to combine. Add in crushed
          tomatoes, stir together, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Season with
          sugar to cut the tomato acidity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Separately, fill a pot with water and season generously with salt.
          Once water is boiling add to the pasta. Cook just under al dente.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a spider, transfer the pasta to the sauce and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the cheese mixture, grate all the cheeses and toss them together.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 9x13 greased baking dish, add in half of the pasta & sauce
          evenly spreading out. Add full-fat ricotta on top followed by half of
          the cheese mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the other half of pasta and sauce, topped with the other half of
          ricotta, and the other half of the cheese mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the dish into the 375F oven for 35 minutes. Remove and let cool
          completely.
        </li>
        <li>Finish with basil leaves on top.</li>
      </ol>
